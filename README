Test cases
~~~~~~~~~~

The file name for test case xxx is "xxx.tc".

The first line contains a description.
The second line contains the language lll as in src/lll/.
The following lines contain variable definitions for building in the
form of "VARIABLE=value" or "export VARIABLE=value", suitable for
